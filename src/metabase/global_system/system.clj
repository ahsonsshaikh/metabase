   A dynamic var has two slots: a root shared by every thread, and a per-thread binding that shadows it.
   This namespace keeps the same two slots for every component.
   All roots live in one atom, so [[snapshot]] reads every root at a single instant.
   Each thread's bindings are an overlay holding only the components bound on that thread, never a copy of the system.
   An unbound component reads straight through to its root, so binding or changing one component never affects
